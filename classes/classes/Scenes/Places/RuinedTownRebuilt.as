You came here with your own quest, your own goals, and…I guess I needed you to refuse me, before it really sunk in.” Amily puts a hand on your shoulder. “I’m sorry. For demanding so much, and then…blowing up on you when you refused.” She hangs her head. “I love you…So much, and I…almost blew it.” Amily looks into your eyes, giving you a hopeful look. “I was able to find a place for now, near the farm. Demons don’t go there, and our kids can get work from Whitney, in exchange for shelter. It’s not a good long-term solution, but…Until we can start construction on the ruins, it’ll do.” She gives you a pleading look, eyes damp.\n\n");
